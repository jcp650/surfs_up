# Surfs Up

## Project Overview

This project seeks to examine weather patterns in Hawaii in order to determine the best place to open a surf board and ice cream shop. Specifically, creating a statistical analysis of temperatures in the summer and winter will help inform whether this business is can survive year round. The main tools used for creating this analysis were sqlalchemy's querying and filtering tools and python's pandas module to analyze the data.

## Results

Three key findings from the temperature analysis for December and June are listed below:

1. The standard deviation for temperatures in December and June are just above 3 which is relatively low. This means the weather does not vary too much, and should be very temperate season to season. This is beneficial to a store that sells surf gear and ice cream because the impact of seasonal weather will be minimal (Figures 1 and 2).
2. The average weather for December and June are warm compared to other climates, which is also beneficial to selling ice cream and surf gear (Figures 1 and 2).
3. The minimum temperature reaches just above 50 degrees fahrenheit in December, which could decrease ice cream sales during the colder days in the winter (Figure 2). However, because the temperatures increase with the percentiles, the cold weather should only affect ice cream sales for a few days in December (Figure 2).

Figure 1 shows the statistical breakdown of temperatures in June, and Figure 2 shows the staistical breakdown of temperatures in December.
